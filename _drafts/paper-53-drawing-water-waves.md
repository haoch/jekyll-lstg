Hopefully parts 2 and 3 of my Mastering Paper by 53 Guide have shown just how easy creating trees and skies can be. Continuing on I'll explain my process for drawing water and waves that can fit any beach or coastline scene. If you picked up on how I draw clouds, the following should be familiar territory since I use the same process.

When choosing a color to represent ocean water, I like to mix them dull and gray by knocking the saturation down. I find this helps arrive at a better base color and contrasts nicely against a bright blue sky. But don't let this mix limit your creative vision, make it as blue or green as you want.

**Pro-tip:** Don't make the mix too dark. I find it easier to build up a color by applying multiple coats instead of going at it with just one. Mix the desired color you'd like to end with and then lower the saturation and luminosity about 25% each. (Refer to Part 1 for details on how)

Much like drawing skies, you can choose to mark a horizon line in pencil to act as a guide --- or go commando if you're confident in your watercolor skills. If you decide to draw the horizon, remember to keep it light so it doesn't bleed through the watercolor we'll be applying next.

With our blue-grey mixed and ready, select the watercolor brush and paint a slow and even stroke to make up this first layer of water. Just like painting skies, you're trying for an even application of watercolor without lifting your stylus or finger off the iPad's screen. Work your stroke from top to bottom, left to right, overlapping the previously painted portion slightly. Think of it as a stroke with a slight zig zag to it.

The slower you go the more evenly paint is distributed and keeps it all smooth and even.

Apply another 2--3 coats using the same even stroke, but as you approach the foreground gradually increase in speed to fade the blue out.

**Pro-tip:** The area nearest the horizon line should be the darkest, and gradually lighten as you move away from it. Applying multiple coats to just the top area of the water and fading it as you work down will help with this effect.

Depending on the amount and intensity of the water's waves this next step might vary some. For the sake of this tutorial I'm going to draw little waves using quick and choppy watercolor brush strokes. The technique is very similar to painting clouds using white, only in this case we're using the same color we painted the water's base with.

A few strokes will do the trick. No need to go overboard with the chop.

**Pro-tip:** If you go too dark, just mix white into your base coat color. Continue adding white until you get a color that has a hint of the base and lightens the water as you paint. It might take trial and error to find this "sweet spot."

## Waves, It's All in the Details

With a solid foundation set, it's time to add the finishing spit and polish to our waves. Using the pencil tool filled with white, lightly sketch strokes from left to right. The size of the waves will determine the direction and angle of these pencil lines --- the larger the waves, the greater the angle.

A Pogo Connect Smart Pen works great for this step. It allows you to draw lightly and avoid going too bright in an area. If you're using a normal stylus without pressure sensitivity or finger painting, remember to move quickly with your pencil strokes. The quicker you draw the lighter the mark.

For the waves' tops or areas where they might be crashing against land I go heavy with the white and try to make it textured and scratchy. Criss-crossing or hatching my strokes is one way of doing this quickly.

To add in shadows use a variation of the water's base color, mixed with 20--40% black. Apply the same technique used above but with this darker color instead of white. Focus on putting a few strokes of dark adjacent to the white strokes to add depth the waves. As always, if you over work an area just rewind or draw over it using white if it's a shadow, and a shadow color if it's white.

Boom! And we're done. Combined with a blue sky from part 2 and you'll have a landscape that will look like you drew it with traditional art supplies. Shhhhh...your secret is safe with me.

## Next Up

The next part will include techniques for drawing various textures using the Paper by 53 tools. Things like wood grain, brick, asphalt, and concrete will all be covered to round out the landscape portion of this guide.
