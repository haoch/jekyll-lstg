# [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com) Source Code

This is the source code of Made Mistakes, a personal blog and portfolio on http://mademistakes.com, hosted by 
[Media Temple](http://mediatemple.net/#a_aid=51686252ceb4c). My overall goal with the site design was to create visually interesting pages that look great and are readable on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

The article layouts are the most fleshed out and *finished*, while  `work.html` used for portfolio and photo pages is still a work in progress.

## Install Jekyll

The following terminal command will install Jekyll and any required RubyGems if you have [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) installed.

``` bash
$ bundle install
```

Or you can just install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) via [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/)

``` bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

---

## Jekyll Plugins

The only plugin that needs installing is the [Jekyll-minibundle](https://github.com/tkareine/jekyll-minibundle) RubyGem.The other plugins are already installed in the `_plugins` folder and should be set to go. 

### [Jekyll-minibundle](https://github.com/tkareine/jekyll-minibundle)

This plugin requires Ruby 1.9.3 so if you don't want to use it just remove the `{% ministamp %}` Liquid tags in `head.html` and `scripts.html`.

To install Jekyll-minibundle use the following terminal command:
``` bash
$ gem install jekyll-minibundle
```

### [Sitemap.xml Generator](http://www.kinnetica.com/projects/jekyll-sitemap-generator/)

Generates a `sitemap.xml` file by traversing all of the available posts and pages.

### svg_mime_type

Serves SVG files with the correct MIME type when running `$ jekyll --server`.

## Layouts

There are three main content `_layouts` used on the site: `post.html`, `page.html`, and `work.html`.

### Post and Page Layouts

The `post.html` and `page.html` layouts are very similar: both pull in large feature images when specified, and both are meant for text heavy blog posts (or articles).

### Portfolio and Image Layout (Work in Progress)

Needs some love, but does work albeit with some messy looking Liquid to keep post pagination isolated to the current category.

### Home and Post Index Layouts

Home page uses the `home.html` layout and is designed to pull in 6 posts (thumbnail image and title) that are tagged `feature` along with the 10 latest posts in `category: articles`. Articles index uses the `post-index.html` layout and is designed to display all posts in the category `articles`.

## Videos

Not sure if this only effects Kramdown or if it's an issue with Markdown in general. But adding YouTube video embeds causes errors when building your Jekyll site. To fix add a space between the `<iframe>` tags and remove `allowfullscreen`. Example below:

``` html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PWf4WUoMXwg" frameborder="0"> </iframe>
```

---

## Useful Commands

Compile site:
``` bash
$ jekyll build
```

Start a Jekyll server at <http://localhost:4000/>, (make sure to enable this url in `_config.yml` so all assets and images have correct absolute url's via the `{{ site.url }}` Liquid tag:
``` bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Minify all .html files in `_site` folder using HTML-compressor:
``` bash
$ rake minify
```

### Grunt Build Script

Grunt build script will compile/minify the LESS files into `main.min.css` and concatenate/minify all scripts into `main.min.js`. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), then [install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then finally install the dependencies for the theme contained in `package.json`:

``` bash
npm install
```

From the site's root, use `grunt` to rebuild the CSS, concatenate JavaScript files, and optimize .jpg, .png, and .svg files in the `images/` folder. For local development `grunt watch` used in combination with `jekyll build --watch` will watch for updates to LESS and JS files that Grunt will then automatically re-build which will in turn cause Jekyll to autogenerate a new `_site` folder for testing.

---

## Deployment

Nothing fancy here.

1. Enable correct `{{ site.url }}` in `_config.yml` (ie: http://mademistakes.com)
2. Run Grunt build script `$ grunt`
3. Run Jekyll `$ jekyll build`
4. Minify HTML `$ rake minify`
5. FTP the contents of the `_site` folder to your webserver
